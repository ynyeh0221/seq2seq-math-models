MathFormer is an innovative deep learning project that demonstrates how transformer-based neural networks can learn to perform fundamental arithmetic operations. The implementation features specialized models for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, each capable of understanding numerical relationships and generating accurate computational results using sequence-to-sequence learning paradigms.

The project showcases a novel transfer learning approach where knowledge from individual operation models is combined through weight averaging and fine-tuning to create a unified model capable of handling multiple mathematical operations simultaneously. This "migration learning" technique demonstrates how neural networks can consolidate specialized knowledge into general mathematical reasoning abilities, providing insights into knowledge transfer between related tasks and potential applications in more complex computational reasoning systems.
